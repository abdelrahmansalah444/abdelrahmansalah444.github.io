    <p class="a">11.Dwayne Douglas Johnson</p>
    <img src="12.jpg" alt="the photo not found"/>
    <P class="a">Born (May 2, 1972)</P>
    <p>He is an American-Canadian actor, film producer, entrepreneur, investor, and retired professional wrestler. Johnson was a professional wrestler for the World Wrestling Federation (WWE (and now WWE) for eight years before pursuing his acting career. His films have grossed over $3.5 billion in North America, and over $10.5 billion worldwide, making Johnson one of the highest-grossing box office stars of all time. Johnson was also a former American football and Canadian football player.</p>
    <p>Johnson was a college football player for the University of Miami, with whom he won a national championship in 1991. Initially aspiring to a professional football career, Johnson entered the 1995 NFL Draft, but did not design. As a result, Johnson signed with the Calgary Stampeders in the Canadian Football League (CFL), but was removed from the team in the middle of his first season. Soon, he started training as a professional wrestler.</p>
    <p>In 1996, Johnson was awarded a contract with the World Wrestling Federation, and was promoted as the first third-generation wrestler in the company's history, as he is the son of Rocky Johnson, and grandson of Peter Maivia. He rose to prominence after developing a charismatic personality for a ostentatious wrestler named "The Rock". He subsequently won his first WWE Championship in 1998, helping him usher in the "Attitude Era", a boom in the company's business in the 1990s and early 2000s, which still holds professional wrestling records for television ratings. In 2004, he left WWE to pursue his acting career, went on a seven-year hiatus, and returned in 2011 as a part-time performer until 2013, appearing sporadically before retiring fully in 2019</p>
    <p>Regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers, and biggest raffles of all time, The Rock topped the newest and most popular pro wrestling push-up event of all time, WrestleMania 28, and featured on WWE's most-watched television series, along with WWE Raw and WWE E Smackdown. He has won many titles, being a two-time WWE Intercontinental Champion, five-time World Tag Team Championship, and ten-time World Tag Team Champion. He was also the winner of the Royal Rumble match, and the sixth WWE Champion for the Triple Crown.</p>
    <p>Johnson has also had success as an author and producer. In 2000, he released his autobiography, The Rock Says..., which debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list. In 2012, he founded the entertainment production company Seven Pax Productions, which has since produced several films and entertainment projects. Ranked among the 100 most influential people in the world in both 2016 and 2019, Johnson was ranked among the world's top actors.</p>
